     * The "Left" side of the scene is Part 1, use Space to make the Hero move. Use backspace to make the patrolling character stop.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * The "Right" side is Part 2. I cheated a little here; rather than figure out how to make the timing work on it's own, numpad 1, 2, and 3 start/stop the first mercenary,
     * 
     * technician, and second mercenary respectively. Holding Numpad Enter turns the technician towards TechnicianTurnToPoint.
     * 
     * Fisher, the one on t he camera's side of the wall, does not move.
